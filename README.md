# MLP-Regressor-Project

The goal of this project is to predict a customerâ€™s purchase value based on their multi-session behavior across digital touchpoints. The dataset captures anonymized user interactions such as browser types, traffic sources, device details, and geographical indicators. By modeling these patterns, participants will estimate the purchase potential of each user, helping optimize marketing and engagement strategies.
